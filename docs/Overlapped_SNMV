## __Overlapped ingle nucleotide methylated variation (SNMV)__



The purpose of this script is to obtain methylated frequency of each motif on MAGs across metagenomic samples.
- Search motifs and methylated motifs from REBASE (___mtase_pickle___ file from the [document](https://github.com/hoonjeseong/Meta-epigenome_analysis/blob/8bd14c73bd7b95333fe8fa2be10bf505c827ed57/utils/MTase_REBASE.md))  or _de novo_ ___5bp motifs___ (NN_A_NN or NN_C_NN; _A_ and _C_ means modified base of 6mA and 4mC which could be detected by PacBio system) on MAGs by each metagenomic sample.
- For simple normalization, only these motifs are counted in 10 dp mapped bredth regions, regardless of the strands in the MAG.
