## __Overlapped single nucleotide methylated variation (SNMV)__

_The purpose of this script is to calculate the fraction of specific methylated motif by each nucleotide position on MAGs across metagenomic samples._

- Before comparison of methylation fraction, you should find DNA methylated motifs of each MAG.
- DNA methylated motifs could be inferred by [finding the highest DNA methylated motif](https://github.com/hoonjeseong/Meta-epigenome_analysis/blob/main/docs/Motif-calculation.md) and [comparing MTase similarity with its recognition motif](https://github.com/hoonjeseong/Meta-epigenome_analysis/blob/main/utils/MTase_REBASE.md).
